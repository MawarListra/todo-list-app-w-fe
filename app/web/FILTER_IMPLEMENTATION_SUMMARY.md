  - Implemented list filtering logic (search, empty/completed states, date range)
  - Implemented task and list sorting functionality
  - Integrated with centralized Zustand filter store
  - Removed unsupported features (tags, dueDate) and adapted to actual Task type structure

### 2. Filter Bar Component (`FilterBar.tsx`)

- **Location**: `/app/web/src/components/features/filters/FilterBar.tsx`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and working
- **Features**:
  - Reusable filter bar that works for both tasks and lists
  - Search functionality with debounced input
  - Filter dropdowns for status, priority, and other criteria
  - Sort options with direction toggle
  - Active filter summary and clear functionality
  - Responsive design with mobile-friendly layout

### 3. Task Filter Demo (`TaskFilterDemo.tsx`)

- **Location**: `/app/web/src/components/features/filters/TaskFilterDemo.tsx`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and working
- **Features**:
  - Demonstrates the filter system in action
  - Mock data with various task types (overdue, completed, different priorities)
  - Live filtering and sorting
  - Visual feedback for filter results
  - Debug information showing filter effectiveness

### 4. App Integration (`App.tsx`)

- **Location**: `/app/web/src/App.tsx`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and working
- **Features**:
  - Integrated TaskFilterDemo into the main app
  - Demonstrates the filter system working end-to-end

## üìã Key Features Implemented

### Filter Capabilities

- **Search**: Full-text search across task titles and descriptions
- **Status Filters**: All, Active, Completed, Overdue, Due Today, Due This Week
- **Priority Filters**: Low, Medium, High priority tasks
- **Date Range Filters**: Filter by creation date range
- **List Filters**: Filter by specific lists

### Sort Capabilities

- **Task Sorting**: By title, created date, updated date, priority, deadline, order
- **List Sorting**: By name, created date, updated date, task count, completion percentage
- **Direction Toggle**: Ascending/descending for all sort options

### State Management

- **Centralized Store**: Uses Zustand for global filter state
- **Persistence**: Filter preferences are saved (via filter store)
- **Performance**: Optimized with React.useMemo for efficient re-renders

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Type Safety

- Fixed all TypeScript errors by importing correct types from `task.types.ts` and `list.types.ts`
- Removed references to non-existent properties (tags, dueDate) and adapted to actual Task interface
- Proper type annotations for all filter and sort operations

### Performance Optimizations

- Used React.useMemo for expensive filtering and sorting operations
- Debounced search input to prevent excessive re-renders
- Efficient array operations with proper dependency arrays

### Code Structure

- Separated concerns with dedicated hook, components, and demo
- Reusable FilterBar component that works for both tasks and lists
- Clear separation between filter logic and UI presentation

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { useFilters } from '@/hooks/useFilters'

function MyComponent() {
  const { processTasksData, setSearchQuery, setTaskFilters } = useFilters()

  const filteredTasks = processTasksData(tasks)

  return (
    <div>
      <FilterBar mode="tasks" />
      {filteredTasks.map((task) => (
        <TaskCard key={task.id} task={task} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Advanced Usage

```tsx
import { useFilters } from '@/hooks/useFilters'

function AdvancedTaskView() {
  const { filterTasks, sortTasks, taskFilters, setTaskFilters, filterSummary } =
    useFilters()

  // Custom filter logic
  const customFilteredTasks = filterTasks(tasks)
  const sortedTasks = sortTasks(customFilteredTasks)

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Active filters: {filterSummary.activeCount}</div>
      <button
        onClick={() => setTaskFilters({ ...taskFilters, priority: 'high' })}
      >
        Show High Priority
      </button>
      {sortedTasks.map((task) => (
        <TaskCard key={task.id} task={task} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## üöÄ Demo

Visit the running app to see the filter system in action:

- Search for tasks by title or description
- Filter by priority (Low, Medium, High)
- Filter by status (All, Active, Completed, Overdue, etc.)
- Sort by various criteria with direction toggle
- See real-time filter results and active filter summary

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

### Not Yet Implemented (but prepared for)

1. **List Integration**: The partially refactored ListGrid component needs completion
2. **Advanced Filters**: Date range picker, custom filter combinations
3. **Filter Presets**: Save and load common filter combinations
4. **Bulk Operations**: Actions on filtered results
5. **Performance**: Virtual scrolling for large datasets

### Ready for Extension

- The filter store is already comprehensive and can handle additional filter types
- The useFilters hook provides both high-level and low-level APIs
- The FilterBar component is extensible for new filter types
- The demo pattern can be replicated for other entity types

## üìä Test Results

- All core filter components compile without TypeScript errors
- Filter logic works correctly with mock data
- State management integrates properly with Zustand store
- UI components render correctly and respond to user interactions
- Performance is optimized with proper memoization

The filter system is now fully functional and ready for use in the todo list application!
